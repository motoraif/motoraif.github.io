One of the hottest topics nowadays is Docker!

<!-- ## Scenario
* There is a Root domain _contoso.com_ which has a child domain called _corp.contoso.com_
* The child domain needs to be separated from its parent. 
* A new Forest is created for that purpose and it will be called _oldboyschool.com_.
* For this scenario to work, I will be using **Active Directory Migration Tool** aka [ADMT v3.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56570),and **Password Export Server** aka [PES v3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1838). -->

#### This will be continued on a later stage.
